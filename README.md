## Idea

The idea is to let users easily change the background of the website. Users can choose any image or color from the options window to overwrite the default background (provided by developer) of the website. And since the background image or color set is saved in local storage of the browser, the background settings will sustain until the user clears local storage.

Most websites today implement change background theme using server side languages. For e.g. Yahoo Mail, Gmail, Twitter etc.
This is not always an easy solution for front end developers and designers. Moreover it kills the performance of the web page.

We always needed a client side solution to make this easier and faster. Hence, this plugin was developed.


## Heavy use of HTML5 local storage

This plugin is mostly based on HTML5 local storage. This plugin uses local storage to save background settings, backgorund colors, background image urls, base64 png images etc. Even today, HTML5 local storage is often underestimated and poorly implemented. But, this plugin was possible only by harnessing the complete potential of html5 local storage.

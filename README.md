## Documentation

###### Getting Started

First of all, include **custombg** folder in your project, exactly where html files of your web pages reside.

This plugin requires jquery and jqueryUI. So, in case you are not already using it please add them. You can find them in  custombg/js/jquery and include it the html head.

Paste the following div just below body start tag
```html
<div id="options-window" class="fg-creamy bg-lightgrey"></div>
```

Now create a button that will load background options window whenever clicked
```html
<input type="button" value="Change Background" onclick="loadOptionsWindow()">
```

Add the loader javascript just before end of body tag.
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="custombg/js/custombg-loader.js"></script>
```

###### Using HTML5 Appcache (Optional)

Though use of appcache is recommended for best possible performance, it is still optional. Please use appcache only if you are comfortable using it. However, if you do not use appcache manifest, you have to depend on leverage browser caching only.

To use appcache, simple include the manifest file named **custombg.manifest** in the html tag of the web page.

```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html manifest="custombg/custombg.manifest">
```

###### Performance Optimized
The total size of this plugin is ~15Mb, 99% of which is only because of images. Please note that these images are never requested if not needed, and are called on-demand using AJAX. You just need to include a tiny custombg-loader.js that calls required html, js, css whenever required i.e. when 'Change Background' button is clicked. The main js file that the loader always calls is mandatory and costs only ~10 Kb (minified) and can further be cached.

##### Changing Images or Themes

To change any image just go to images/bg-themes/ and replace existing image(s) with new one(s).
To do this, change themes's folder name in images/bg-themes/ and just find and replace 'Old theme name' with 'new theme name' in entire 'custombg' folder.

## Idea

The idea is to let users easily change the background of the website. Users can choose any image or color from the options window to overwrite the default background (provided by developer) of the website. And since the background image or color set is saved in local storage of the browser, the background settings will sustain until the user clears local storage.

Most websites today implement change background theme using server side languages. For e.g. Yahoo Mail, Gmail, Twitter etc.
This is not always an easy solution for front end developers and designers. Moreover it kills the performance of the web page.

We always needed a client side solution to make this easier and faster. Hence, this plugin was developed.


## Heavy use of HTML5 local storage

This plugin is mostly based on HTML5 local storage. This plugin uses local storage to save background settings, backgorund colors, background image urls, base64 png images etc. Even today, HTML5 local storage is often underestimated and poorly implemented. But, this plugin was possible only by harnessing the complete potential of html5 local storage.
